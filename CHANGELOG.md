- [BREAKING] Installed missing optional dependencies (rimraf, cross-env), and changed npm tasks to use them directly instead of npx/pnpx
- [BREAKING] Changed very conservative browserslist string from `last 3 years` to `last 2 versions and >1%`. It will generate more modern build, hopefully smaller and faster. To verify if it satisfies your requirements run `pnpx browserslist "last 2 versions and >1%"` in your terminal and check if browsers you support are there.
